/**
 * useBlockSync is a side effect which handles bidirectional sync between the
 * block-editor store and a controlling data source which provides blocks. This
 * is most commonly used by the BlockEditorProvider to synchronize the contents
 * of the block-editor store with the root entity, like a post.
 *
 * Another example would be the template part block, which provides blocks from
 * a separate entity data source than a root entity. This hook syncs edits to
 * the template part in the block editor back to the entity and vice-versa.
 *
 * Here are some of its basic functions:
 * - Initalizes the block-editor store for the given clientID to the blocks
 *   given via props.
 * - Adds incoming changes (like undo) to the block-editor store.
 * - Adds outgoing changes (like editing content) to the controlling entity,
 *   determining if a change should be considered persistent or not.
 * - Handles edge cases and race conditions which occur in those operations.
 * - Ignores changes which happen to other entities (like nested inner block
 *   controllers.
 * - Passes selection state from the block-editor store to the controlling entity.
 *
 * @param {Object} props Props for the block sync hook
 * @param {string} props.clientId The client ID of the inner block controller.
 *                                If none is passed, then it is assumed to be a
 *                                root controller rather than an inner block
 *                                controller.
 * @param {Object[]} props.value  The control value for the blocks. This value
 *                                is used to initalize the block-editor store
 *                                and for resetting the blocks to incoming
 *                                changes like undo.
 * @param {Object} props.selectionStart The selection start vlaue from the
 *                                controlling component.
 * @param {Object} props.selectionEnd The selection end vlaue from the
 *                                controlling component.
 * @param {onBlockUpdate} props.onChange Function to call when a persistent
 *                                change has been made in the block-editor blocks
 *                                for the given clientId. For example, after
 *                                this function is called, an entity is marked
 *                                dirty because it has changes to save.
 * @param {onBlockUpdate} props.onInput Function to call when a non-persistent
 *                                change has been made in the block-editor blocks
 *                                for the given clientId. When this is called,
 *                                controlling sources do not become dirty.
